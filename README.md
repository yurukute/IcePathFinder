# Ice Path Finder
College project - Using Blind Search Algorithms To Find Ice Path

## Overview
Ice Path Finder is a python project apply blind search algorithms to solve Ice Maze. The original problem is from [\[ASCII Games: Warning: Ice!\] kata on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58f4cc4e43251b1be6000082) but skip the requirement on checking multiple solutions with the same amount of steps.

### Purpose
Practice on Object-oriented programming.

Learn how to use Qt framework with PyQt.

Revise searching algorithms, data structures and graph theory.

## Features
Generate random maze.

Load maze text file from system.

Solve the maze using BFS and DFS algorithms.

Allow user to change ice path's color.

Support 2 different languages: English and Vietnamese.
